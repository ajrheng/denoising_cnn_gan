This repository contains code to train a CNN Autoencoder and GAN in medical image denoising.
This is for the course project CSC413/2516 Winter 2021 Neural Networks and Deep Learning at the University of Toronto.

Download the train and test datasets as follows:

Train: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mdOBGAhsSTcsaQI3WPqjUjLXtXp-NwBw/view?usp=sharing)
Test: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gmMfHuljO6qTJFmclmVtflJsfXc-1VZs/view?usp=sharing)

Extract them in the main directory of this project. Then you can train and test the CNN Autoencoder by running
`train_cnn_autoencoder.ipynb`, and the GAN by running `train_gan.ipynb`.
